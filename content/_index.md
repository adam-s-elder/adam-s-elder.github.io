# Welcome 
I am a Ph.D. student in biostatistics at the University of Washington. 

The primary goal of my research is to improve decision making for public health interventions. This includes developing methodologies that the most accurate estimates of population level parameters while limiting assumptions to those that are confidently known. 

Who knows if this will work. Like what??  Haha

Much of my applied work has or will be used to help public health organizations gain a better understanding of both the current state of infectious disease epidemiology and which interventions are the most promising.  

I am jointly advised by [Alex Luedtke](http://www.alexluedtke.com) and [Marco Carone](https://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html).
