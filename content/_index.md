# Welcome 
I am a Ph.D. student in biostatistics at the University of Washington. 

The primary goal of my research is to improve estimation and inferential methods used for public health interventions. This includes developing methodologies that provide the most accurate estimates of population level parameters while limiting assumptions to those that are confidently known. Much of my applied work has or will be used to help public health organizations gain a better understanding of both the current state of epidemics and which interventions are the most promising.

I am jointly advised by [Alex Luedtke](http://www.alexluedtke.com) and [Marco Carone](https://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html).  I have also worked as a research assistant for [Martina Morris](http://faculty.washington.edu/morrism/).
